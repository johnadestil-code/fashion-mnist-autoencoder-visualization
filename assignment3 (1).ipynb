    "## Autoencoders on Fashion-MNIST\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this assignment is to implement and train __autoencoders__ on the __Fashion-MNIST__ dataset to learn compressed representations of images. You will explore how well autoencoders can reconstruct images and evaluate their usefulness for representation learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Dataset Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Load the Fashion-MNIST dataset (28×28 grayscale images of clothing categories).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Normalize pixel values to the range [0, 1].\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Split into training and test sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Autoencoder Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Build a basic autoencoder with the following structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Encoder: compress input images to a low-dimensional latent space (e.g., 16-32–64 dimensions).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Decoder: reconstruct images from the latent representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Use fully connected layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Activation functions: ReLU for hidden layers, Sigmoid for the output layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Training\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Train the autoencoder using the reconstruction loss (e.g., Mean Squared Error or Binary Cross-Entropy).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Experiment with different latent space dimensions (e.g., 16, 32, 64) and compare reconstruction quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Evaluation & Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Reconstruct a set of test images and compare them visually to the original images.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Plot training and validation loss curves.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Visualize the learned latent space (use 2D projection via PCA or t-SNE if latent space >2D).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Analysis (Written Response)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - How well does the autoencoder reconstruct different types of clothing (e.g., T-shirt vs. ankle boot)?\n",
    "\n",
    "    - How does the latent dimension size affect reconstruction quality?\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Discuss the trade-off between compression and reconstruction accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Why might autoencoders be useful beyond reconstruction (e.g., anomaly detection, feature extraction)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deliverables:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python code (well-documented, preferably in PyTorch or TensorFlow).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Plots and visualizations:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Original vs. reconstructed images.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Training/validation loss curves.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Latent space visualization (PCA or t-SNE).\n",
    "\n",
    "* A written analysis addressing the discussion questions."
