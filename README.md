# fashion-mnist-autoencoder-visualization
Built and trained fully-connected autoencoders in PyTorch to compress 28×28 Fashion-MNIST images into latent embeddings (16/32/64) and reconstruct inputs using MSE loss.  Evaluated model behavior across latent sizes using reconstruction grids and train/validation loss curves, comparing compression vs. accuracy trade-offs.
